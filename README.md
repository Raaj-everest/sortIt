# sortIt

I am dividing you guys into 2 groups, you should collaborate on a simple project.
Java Group: @Yashaswini Yellapu, @L Rajesh Yadav
Python Group: @wenkey, @Shireen Azad , @Pravallika Pulivendula
Project Name: SortIt :grin: . It should be your repo name. Basically it should have sorting algorithms. Pick what ever sorting algorithms you find it easy ( google it, learn it ). Each person  from the group will add one sorting algorithm to the project
Guidelines:
There should be only 1 Repo per group ( so 2 repos because you are 2 groups ). Discuss among yourselves and decide who creates the repo.
Use Code Formatter for your code. It formats the code, and make it looks neat. ( VSCode has extensions for it )
Goal is not to get any conflicts, Coordinate among yourselves ( it is okay even if you get, but try not to )
Create PRs, and ask other people to review it once, and send it to me for review. Merge them once the review got approved.
If you get any other task from @Ranganathan B , feel free to leave this. (edited) 

I picked Sorting algorithms, assuming you all knew it.
sortit
    ├── bubble_sort.py
    ├── insertion_sort.py
    └── merge_sort.py
^^ this should be the directory structure for your project ( for java people extension will be .java )
Help each other in learning sorting algorithms. Main focus is not to learn algorithms. It is to learn Git
